OS Scheduler Simulation
=======================

## John Harvey

### About
C program developed on Ubuntu to simulate a running operating system's scheduling of processes. The code is one process/thread only and the 'processes' are just data structures in the simulation. The simulation assumes one processor with one core. It assumes all user processes with kernel taking no time to do its work. Time will be the main loop one clock tick per iteration. One time through the loop - one clock tick. A custom priority queue is used.
